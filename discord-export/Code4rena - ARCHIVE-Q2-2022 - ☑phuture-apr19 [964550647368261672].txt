Hi everyone, excited to get this audit underway. Please feel free to reach out to @Alex M , @hvrlk and @lepeico with any questions you may have related to our codebase.

Hey there, @lepeico 
I was wondering where are `IIndexRegistry` and `IIndexfactory` implemented?
They are referenced/called a lot throughout the codebase but I can't seem to locate implementations.


[04/19/2022 2:54 AM] vad37
Would be great if we have all tests and package.json or lib file included as well. It would be so much faster for us to understand the project.

`INameRegistry` implementation is also missing


[04/19/2022 8:56 AM] alex_melnichuk
Hey everyone


[04/19/2022 8:56 AM] alex_melnichuk
IIndexRegistry and IIndexfactory were excluded, since we need to have a limited number of lines of code for this audit


[04/19/2022 8:57 AM] alex_melnichuk
Unfortunately, the two contracts above were out of scope


[04/19/2022 9:15 AM] vad37
Could have left out UniswapV2 oracle contract. I didnt see it used anywhere.

Also where is the most important contract that handle `ORDERER_ROLE`.
The only contract can transfer people token away is not included


[04/19/2022 9:21 AM] hvrlk#0284
UniswapV2 can be set as price oracle for specific asset in PhuturePriceOracle


[04/19/2022 9:24 AM] hvrlk#0284
Orderer contract also was excluded


[04/19/2022 9:29 AM] bernd_42
I understand that the scope of this audit is limited, still, it would be great to have the whole codebase (including tests) to get a full understanding and to run tests. Contracts to be audited can still be limited by explicitly declaring them in the README


[04/19/2022 9:32 AM] alex_melnichuk
We're ready to provide the full repo if we're allowed)


[04/19/2022 9:38 AM] Oliver | Phuture#0686
We have provided the code that handles the user facing flows such as the minting and burning of indices. The code that has been omitted is related to the execution of trades to rebalance our indices and is only performed by  Phuture with the correct permissions.


[04/19/2022 9:44 AM] t.nero.kenshin
Could you share a setup code so we can setup testing env properly?


[04/19/2022 10:22 AM] Oliver | Phuture#0686
At this time we cant share a setup code because you have only got a subset of the contracts.


[04/19/2022 10:23 AM] Oliver | Phuture#0686
Our goal with this audit is to find any vulnerabilities within the subset of contracts provided


[04/19/2022 10:31 AM] vad37
What is the different and purpose between TrackedIndex,ManagedIndex and TopNMarketCapIndex?


[04/19/2022 10:38 AM] Oliver | Phuture#0686
Did you see definitions in glossary?


[04/19/2022 10:53 AM] vad37
Yeah i see it, I just dont understand what reweight asset for and where it is used


[04/19/2022 10:54 AM] vad37
Like ManagedIndex have access control for reweight. But manged what? Why it need special access?


[04/19/2022 10:57 AM] vad37
And what factory suppose to do for the user?


[04/19/2022 10:57 AM] vad37
Create new index for each token, pool?


[04/19/2022 10:58 AM] illilli000
often times sponsors will link to the public repository which is not in scope, so that everything that's not included in scope can still be used to e.g. build/test


[04/19/2022 11:05 AM] hvrlk#0284
It has special access because manager of that index can set assets and weights for this index by himself. Weights for Tracked and TopNMarketCap indices are based on market capitalisations


[04/19/2022 11:07 AM] hvrlk#0284
It validates input needed for index creation and checks that new index is unique


[04/19/2022 11:18 AM] vad37
Who can call Orderer contract to reweight all asset pool which automatically buy/sell token to balance out asset or pool price to fit market?


[04/19/2022 11:20 AM] vad37
Is that what reweight method do? figure out new market price and balance out the pool?


[04/19/2022 11:21 AM] lepeico
Orderer methods are only callable for whitelisted (with ORDER_EXECUTOR_ROLE granted on IndeexRegistry contract) keepers through Job contract


[04/19/2022 11:26 AM] hvrlk#0284
IndexRegistry contract contains openzeppelin's AccessControl, so that's the reason why all permission's checks are pointed to `registry`


[04/19/2022 11:28 AM] vad37
Is there any concern or protection against frontrun or sandwich attack for reweight()? Since you guys have both uniswap oracle and no timelock for mint/burn vToken


[04/19/2022 11:33 AM] hvrlk#0284
it updates weights for Tracked index, weight and assets  for TopNMarketCap index to suit current market capitalizations of assets


[04/19/2022 12:22 PM] hvrlk#0284
we going to use chainlink's prices for most of assets, also uniswap's price updates no more than once per day


[04/19/2022 12:27 PM] hvrlk#0284

[04/19/2022 11:40 PM] 100proof
What is the `UQ` format?


[04/20/2022 12:09 AM] pedroais
In my opinion it isn't possible to make a full audit of these contracts if we can't see the functions that are being called. Contracts aren't isolated things we can audit one by one. They form a system and we only have one face of the coin. How can we say a contract is safe if it makes calls to other contracts we can't see ?

In addition, two contracts can be "safe" by themselves but the way they interact with each other could still be wrong.

Just my humble opinion, I think releasing the rest of the code would improve the quality of the audit.

Appreciate you raising it. I‚Äôm afk for the day but will take a look at this soon.

[04/20/2022 3:00 AM] t.nero.kenshin
So the most vulns can only be proved by assumption (or partially proved) due to the limitation that we are unable to setup a proper env, is that still acceptable?


[04/20/2022 4:49 AM] 100proof
@hvrlk @lepeico I'd like to know more about how `IvToken` contracts. I see that there is a method, `IvTokenFactory.createOrReturnVTokenOf`, that brings them into existence. 

However, what's not clear to me is how shares are calculated, etc.

Let's just start with some basic questions:

We have this structure:
```
    struct AssetData {
        uint maxShares;
        uint amountInAsset;
    }
```

`maxShares` seems straightforward enough, but what exactly does `amountInAsset` measure? What are its units?


[04/20/2022 4:52 AM] 100proof
Also tagging @Alex M


[04/20/2022 8:48 AM] hvrlk#0284
it's 2^112


[04/20/2022 8:58 AM] bernd_42
In the README in "Index evaluation flow" it states: "4. Depositing. Whenever assets are deposited into an index, index tokens are minted and sent to the depositor‚Äôs address". Where does this happen in the smart contracts?


[04/20/2022 9:06 AM] hvrlk#0284
BaseIndex and IndexLogic contracts


[04/20/2022 9:06 AM] hvrlk#0284
amountInAsset - value of assets for given shares


[04/20/2022 9:07 AM] alex_melnichuk
The reference for our NAV/vToken amount of shares can be found here:

how the gas reports will be judged in this case? Without the complete codebase and the optimization level used by compiler, it will be hard to benchmark the savings, I think


[04/20/2022 3:47 PM] Oliver | Phuture#0686
Probably a question for @ü¶ñ eric (ninek) | C4


[04/20/2022 3:56 PM] bernd_42
As far as I understand, the index creator receives index ERC20 tokens after transferring asset tokens (depositing) and calling ‚Äúmint()‚Äù. What are the steps for an investor to invest in this index?


[04/20/2022 11:27 PM] abhinavmir#1898
There are some non-severe known issues with using a certain library you have used in your codebase - will that count in report? What counts as low sev and high sev?


[04/20/2022 11:32 PM] abhinavmir#1898
If we have access to tests or at least a sample user walkthru, it'll help us test for potential gas eaters. A code coverage above 90% is always easier to test imo.


[04/21/2022 12:14 AM] Oliver | Phuture#0686
It all counts, please submit what you found


[04/21/2022 5:04 PM] abhinavmir#1898
sg Oliver, on it!


[04/21/2022 7:36 PM] abhinavmir#1898
Submitted my first report with Phuture, excited for feedback and such!
